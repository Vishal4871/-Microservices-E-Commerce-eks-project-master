Project Overview

This project is a Microservices-based E-Commerce Application deployed on AWS EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service). It demonstrates how a real-world scalable e-commerce system can be designed using Docker, Kubernetes, AWS services, and CI/CD practices.

The application is divided into multiple independent microservices such as User, Product, Order, Payment, and Cart, each deployed as a separate Kubernetes service. The architecture ensures scalability, fault tolerance, and easy maintenance.
